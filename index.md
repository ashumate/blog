# Welcome to another random blog

This is my personal blog where I will pontificate on any number of things adding to the great cacophany that is the World Wide Web. I have a wide variety of interests and intend to use this as a place more to get ideas out of my head, I really don't expect to influence many people but simply share what I know, have learned, and feel about various topics whether it's photography, information security, amateur radio, etc.
